## Creating a .yml file

The `.yml` file is where the instructions for the site and the site navigation live. `yml` is short for `Yet Another Markup Language (yaml)`. 

The `yml` file is simply a text file (use `File > New file > Text File` in RStudio). Save it as `_site.yml` or it won't work. [You can also create a regular Rmarkdown file and then choose the menu in the bottom right of the writing pane to change it to yaml]. 

###Content of the _site.yml file

The content of the `yml` file should look something like the below. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
name: "little-book-of-RStudio-websites"
navbar:
  left:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "Create a Project"
      href: project.html
    - text: "Set Build Options"
      href: build.html
    - text: "Create a _site.yml"
      href: create_yml.html
    - text: "Tables and Plots"
      href: tables_plots.html
    - text: "Include Images"
      href: images.html
    - text: "Embed a webpage"
      href: embed.html
    - text: "Themes"
      href: theme.html
    - text: "Publishing your site"
      href: publishing.html
output_dir: "." # if publishing on Github pages
```
