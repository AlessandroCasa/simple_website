Including an image using rmarkdown is easy. 

In the files pane in RStudion choose `New Folder` (or create on in your Finder in the Rproject folder). Call it say `images`.

To reference an image in rmarkdown use the following. 


`![](images/yourimagename.png)`

Here is an example of the image used in this site
